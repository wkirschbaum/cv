=== Unboxed Consulting
Software Developer ( May 2013 â€“ July 2015 )

==== Julie's Bicycle

Julie's Bicycle is a UK charity that has developed a Ruby on Rails application named igtools for recording, calculating and benchmarking CO2 emissions for Events, Productions, Festivals etc. I was the lead developer in a 3-person team to add a dashboard for licensees. The dashboard gives a detailed overview of how the CO2 emissions are affected by the data collected from the organisation's activities.

====  Contiki

Since I started at Unboxed I have worked primarily on the website application that powers Contiki Holidays. Most of the work that I have done has been enhancing the application and stabilising functionality of this Ruby on Rails application.

==== Contiki | Enhanced Content Hub

I worked in a 2-person team to add integration to Contiki for sharing content across the TravCorp companies.

==== Contiki | Trip Managers

I worked in a 2-person team to add integration with Plansheet for adding Contiki trip managers to their tour's social groups.

==== Contiki | Ruby on Rails Upgrade

I was the main contributor for upgrading the Contiki application from Rails 2 to Rails 3. Contiki was one of the early adopters of Rails, with the application under continuous development since 2006.
