=== Prodigy Finance
Software Developer ( August 2016 â€“ present )

I am currently a senior developer in the Technical department of Prodigy Finance.

My time at Prodigy Finance was spent well, attending an internal leadership program, participating in decisions around company growth and hosting multiple workshops around software security and developer patterns.
I have learned a fair amount about scaling teams and handling common growing pains. For a good part of the this year, I shared product ownership responsibilities with a colleague and gained familiarity with the Product Owner role.

Responsibilities include:

* Teaching other developers by running workshops and pairing/reviewing any work
* Being available for impediments, to assist where possible
* Stand in for product or agile roles when required
* Be available for support when something goes wrong
* Participate in decisions around company growth
